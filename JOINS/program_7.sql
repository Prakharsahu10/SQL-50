There is no primary key (column with unique values) for this table. It may contain duplicates.
Each student from the Students table takes every course from the Subjects table.
Each row of this table indicates that a student with ID student_id attended the exam of subject_name.
 

Write a solution to find the number of times each student attended each exam.

Return the result table ordered by student_id and subject_name.

The result format is in the following example.

Explanation: 
The result table should contain all students and all subjects.
Alice attended the Math exam 3 times, the Physics exam 2 times, and the Programming exam 1 time.
Bob attended the Math exam 1 time, the Programming exam 1 time, and did not attend the Physics exam.
Alex did not attend any exams.
John attended the Math exam 1 time, the Physics exam 1 time, and the Programming exam 1 time.

-- The query selects the student ID, student name, subject name, and the count of attended exams for each student in each subject.
-- It uses a CROSS JOIN to combine all students with all subjects, ensuring that every student is represented for each subject.
-- A LEFT JOIN is then used to count the number of times each student attended the exam for each subject.
-- The results are grouped by student ID, student name, and subject name to get the count of attended exams.
-- Finally, the results are ordered by student ID and subject name.
